![screenshot](http://tristan.moe/lyrical-0.3.png)

### Features
- Live refresh of the lyrics of your song, using Musixmatch service
    - Compatible with iTunes on macOS (tested on OS X 10.11 64-bits)
    - Compatible with iTunes on Windows (tested on Windows 10 64-bits)

### Future goals
- Support more platforms and players
- Offer other lyrics service if Musixmatch still won't allow me full access on the actual one

### Legalese
- This is FREE software. If you bought it, please ask for a refund. It is open-source and available under the GNU GPL v3 license, which means you can do whatever you wish out of this software (preferraly contribute to the source code though :)
- The lyrics provided are NOT intended for commercial use, in ANY way. Please see Musixmatch's legal terms for more informations on that matter.
