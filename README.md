# Lyrical
This is an application aiming for easier lyrics consultation when you play songs.

It uses the Musixmatch service and works only on iTunes on macOS for now, but compatibility will be further expanded in the future.

Please keep in mind that this is a very early stage of the development and (almost) everything is yet to be done.

That said, if you're interested, you can compile and run it using maven. Install it then use 'mvn package' to create a jar file that can be executed.

Thanks for your interest.
